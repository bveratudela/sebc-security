# Security Services Enablement Bootcamp (SEBC)

In this bootcamp, you should walk away with a better understanding of what it takes to secure Cloudera clusters. More specifically, you will gain hands on experience with:

<li>Setting up Kerberos</li>
<li>Setting up LDAP</li>
<li>Setting up Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) with Sentry</li>
<li>Setting up Transport Layer Security (TLS)</li>
<li>Learning about Data-at-Rest Encryption</li>

You will start the bootcamp on day 1 instantiating your cluster. It is expected that you know how to build yours with little to no help. Once your cluster is up and running, you will enable the OS with SSSD and LDAP (in lieu of more enterprise grade solutions such as Centrify and Active Directory). Then we will follow with securing the cluster. The agenda will be:

<li>Day 1: <a href="README.md">Intro</a> (AM) and <a href="setup">Cluster Setup</a> (PM)</li>
<li>Day 2: <a href="kerberos">Kerberos</a> (AM) and <a href="ldap">LDAP Auth</a> (PM)</li>
<li>Day 3: <a href="tls>TLS</a> (AM) and <a href="sentry">Sentry</a> (PM)</li>
<li>Day 4: <a href="navigator">Navigator</a> (AM) and <a href="dare-crypt">Data-at-Rest Encryption</a> (PM)</li>
<li>Day 5: <a href="challenge">Challenge</a> (AM)</li>

At the end of the bootcamp, you will be requested to submit a feedback survey which can be found <a href="survey">here</a>
